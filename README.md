# HBDownloaderChromeExt
A Chrome Extension that downloads from a Humble Bundle Page

I wrote this as a way to teach myself how to write a basic Chome Extension, but also to download eBooks from the Humble Bundles I've collected over the past 10 years.

I found a few Humble Bundle downloaders, but they didn't work exactly like I wanted.

This still needs a lot of work, and who knows if I'll ever do it.  Right now, if it's enabled, it will immediately start a download if the user goes to one of the pages in Humble Bundle that shows a purchase and allows downloads.

I'm putting it here mainly so I have a backup and so I can look at it for reference for making other Chrome Extensions.
